<p><b>5.4</b> Third parties who provide products and services<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work closely with various third parties to bring you a range of products and services which are complimentary to ours.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you enquire about or purchase one or more of these products or services through us (e.g. via our websites), the relevant third party may use your details to provide you with information and carry out their obligations arising from any contracts you have entered into with them.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>These third party product providers may share your information with us which we will use in accordance with this policy. In some cases, they will be acting as a controller of your information and therefore we advise you to read their privacy policy.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.5 Other ways we may share your personal information<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation. We may also transfer your personal information if weâre under a duty to disclose or share it in order to comply with any legal obligation (e.g. by sharing your personal information with the DVLA), to detect or report a crime, to enforce or apply the terms of our contracts or to protect the rights, property or safety of our visitors and customers.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we will always take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>

Further countries listed in our Consent Management System under âCookie Settingsâ in the footer at the bottom of our website). By way of example, this may happen where any of our group companies are incorporated in a country outside of the EEA or if any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6.2</b>&nbsp;If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to âinternational frameworksâ (including but not limited to the use of EU standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or other applicable instruments (if any) that aim to ensure adequate protection.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ and in limited cases, the law permits us to keep your personal information indefinitely provided we put certain protections in place.<br>

 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you may ask for your personal information to be removed from our systems by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy.

 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>9.1 Security measures we put in place to protect your personal information<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>All companies within the Mercedes-Benz Group use technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information supplied by you and managed by us against manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by third parties. Our security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information whilst in transit to our website and any transmission is at your own risk.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access an account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.2 Use of 'cookies'<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent to your device and stored on its hard drive to allow our websites to recognise you when you visit. Information on the cookies that we use and their features can be found in the <a href="passengercars/content-pool/tool-pages/legal/cookies.html" class="wb-link wb-link--inline" target="_blank" data-nn-externallink>cookies section</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.3 Links to other websites<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites and Appsâ so we encourage you to read their privacy statements. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and Apps (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if you linked to our website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.4 Third Parties and Social plugins<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Our websites may also contain third-party offers. If you click on any such offers, we will transfer the amount of data required to the appropriate provider (e.g. the fact that you found the offer in question on our website and, if applicable, additional information that you have already provided for this purpose on our websites).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>On our websites, whenever we use so-called "social plugins" from social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter TikTok, Linked In and YouTube we incorporate them in the manner described below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, social media plugins are deactivated. That means no information whatsoever is transferred to the operators of those networks. If you wish to use one of the networks, click on the appropriate plugin in order to be connected directly to that network's server.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a user account with that network and are logged in at the moment you activate the plugin, the network will be able to detect your visit to our websites and assign it to your user account. If you wish to prevent that, please log off from the network before activating the social plugin. A social network will not be able to detect that you have visited other Mercedes-Benz websites unless you have activated its social plugin on those sites as well.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you activate a social plugin, the network transfers the content thus made available directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our websites. In that situation, data transfers initiated and controlled by the respective social network may also take place. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers that take place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed exclusively by the respective network's data protection provisions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The social plugin will remain active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies.<br>

Please keep these circumstances in mind before you click on a link or activate a social plugin, thereby causing your data to be transferred.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Your Eligibility for Credit<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>In order to process your eligibility check, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). We will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will provide us with information about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Assess your creditworthiness, such as assessing how you have maintained previous and current credit commitments; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Trace you at your supplied address(es) using publicly available information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any queries relating to your eligibility decision, please speak to your local Showroom.</p>

<p><b>Your Application for Credit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to process your application, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). We may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your agreement with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will provide us with information about you. CRAs will supply public (such as the electoral register) and shared credit information. This will include information relating to both your financial situation and history in addition to information used for the purposes of fraud prevention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use this information to:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Assess your creditworthiness and determine whether you can afford to take the vehicle<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Manage your account(s)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Trace and recover debts<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>â¢ Ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are making a joint application, or inform us that you have a spouse, partner or financial associate, we will link your records together. Please ensure you discuss this with the relevant parties, and share this information with them, before lodging the credit application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or any other individual involved in a joint application successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are making this application as a partner in a firm or as the director of a limited company, MBFS may also carry out searches with credit reference and/or fraud prevention agencies in respect of other partners and directors.

We, and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We process your personal data because we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity to protect our business, and to comply with the law. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of our provision of financial services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Automated Decisions<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Consequences of Processing<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the financial services you have requested, or we may cease to provide existing services to you.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, finance or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Transfer of Data<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data. This protects your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to 'international frameworks' intended to enable secure data sharing.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Your Legal Rights<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Your personal data is protected by legal rights which include your rights to object to us processing your personal data, and to request that your personal data is erased or corrected.

                    <p><b>9. SECURITY / COOKIES / LINKS / SOCIAL PLUGINS<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>9.1 Security measures we put in place to protect your personal information<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>All companies within the Mercedes-Benz Group use technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information supplied by you and managed by us against manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by third parties. Our security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information whilst in transit to our website and any transmission is at your own risk.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access an account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.2 Use of 'cookies'<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent to your device and stored on its hard drive to allow our websites to recognise you when you visit. Information on the cookies that we use and their features can be found in the <a href="passengercars/content-pool/tool-pages/legal/cookies.html" class="wb-link wb-link--inline" target="_blank" data-nn-externallink>cookies section</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.3 Links to other websites<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites and Appsâ so we encourage you to read their privacy statements. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and Apps (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if you linked to our website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9.4 Third Parties and Social plugins<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Our websites may also contain third-party offers. If you click on any such offers, we will transfer the amount of data required to the appropriate provider (e.g. the fact that you found the offer in question on our website and, if applicable, additional information that you have already provided for this purpose on our websites).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>On our websites, whenever we use so-called "social plugins" from social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter TikTok, Linked In and YouTube we incorporate them in the manner described below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, social media plugins are deactivated. That means no information whatsoever is transferred to the operators of those networks. If you wish to use one of the networks, click on the appropriate plugin in order to be connected directly to that network's server.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a user account with that network and are logged in at the moment you activate the plugin, the network will be able to detect your visit to our websites and assign it to your user account. If you wish to prevent that, please log off from the network before activating the social plugin. A social network will not be able to detect that you have visited other Mercedes-Benz websites unless you have activated its social plugin on those sites as well.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you activate a social plugin, the network transfers the content thus made available directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our websites. In that situation, data transfers initiated and controlled by the respective social network may also take place. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers that take place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed exclusively by the respective network's data protection provisions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The social plugin will remain active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further information on cookies can be found at: <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.co.uk/passengercars/mercedes-benz-cars/cookies/cookies.module.html" class="wb-link wb-link--inline" target="_blank" data-nn-externallink>https://www.mercedes-benz.co.uk/passengercars/mercedes-benz-cars/cookies/cookies.module.html</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you click on the link to an offer or activate a social plugin, your personal information may be transferred to providers in countries outside the UK or European Economic Area that, from the standpoint of the European Union ("EU"), do not guarantee an "appropriate level of protection" meeting EU standards for processing personal information. Please keep these circumstances in mind before you click on a link or activate a social plugin, thereby causing your data to be transferred.</p>

However, an equivalent level of protection can be created for individual instances of processing using an appropriate transfer mechanism such as specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or binding corporate rules.<br>

<p><br>
<b>Your Eligibility for Credit<br>

<p><b>Your Application for Credit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to process your application, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). We may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your agreement with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will provide us with information about you. CRAs will supply public (such as the electoral register) and shared credit information. This will include information relating to both your financial situation and history in addition to information used for the purposes of fraud prevention.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are making a joint application, or inform us that you have a spouse, partner or financial associate, we will link your records together. Please ensure you discuss this with the relevant parties, and share this information with them, before lodging the credit application.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are making this application as a partner in a firm or as the director of a limited company, MBFS may also carry out searches with credit reference and/or fraud prevention agencies in respect of other partners and directors.

We, and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We process your personal data because we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity to protect our business, and to comply with the law. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of our provision of financial services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Automated Decisions<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Consequences of Processing<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the financial services you have requested, or we may cease to provide existing services to you.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, finance or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Transfer of Data<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data. This protects your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to 'international frameworks' intended to enable secure data sharing.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Your Legal Rights<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Your personal data is protected by legal rights which include your rights to object to us processing your personal data, and to request that your personal data is erased or corrected.

                    <p><u>General Terms &amp; Conditions<br>
 <br>
 </u>Mercedes-Benz UK Limited (the âProviderâ) reserves the right to block a user or otherwise take appropriate measures in the event of indications of misuse of the online service or a use that violates these General Terms and Conditions/Terms of Use. In particular, a use shall be deemed to be abusive if a user uses the website or information provided therein outside of the intended purposes of use, uses the system for illegal purposes or purposes that infringe the rights of the Provider or third parties, or uses the systems in non-compliance with other guidelines provided for by the Provider.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the user assures that the information provided in accordance with these General Terms and Conditions/Terms of Use, is true and complete. The user undertakes to inform the Provider immediately of any future changes to the data provided.<br>
<br>
In addition, the user undertakes to ensure that the hardware and software used by the user when using the systems, including workstations, routers, data communication systems, etc., are free of viruses, worms, Trojans, etc. With regard to the data uploaded by the user, the user undertakes to ensure that he is the owner of all rights to the uploaded data and can freely dispose of the use, including, among other things, that the uploaded data is not encumbered with the rights of third parties that prevent such use.<br>
<br>
In particular, the online service may not be used to disseminate information that meets the following criteria:<br>
<br>
a) racist, inhuman slogans<br>
<br>
b) provision of false or otherwise incorrect information<br>
<br>
c) abusive, aggressive, harassing, hateful, obscene, threatening or otherwise objectionable<br>
<br>
d) Information that violates legal requirements or that does not sufficiently comply with or implement applicable requirements (e.g. in the case of labeling or transparency obligations)<br>
<br>
e) information, of which the provision or dissemination constitutes a criminal offence or an administrative offence;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Measures to be taken in the event of violations<br>
 <br>
 </u>If the information provided violates these General Terms and Conditions/Terms of Use and the Provider becomes aware of this (e.g. through a report by another user), the Provider reserves the right to block or delete such content immediately (if necessary, only temporarily) and to take all further necessary steps.<br>
<br>
If necessary or appropriate, the following measures will be taken depending on the severity, frequency and number of violations:<br>
<br>
a) temporary or permanent deletion of content<br>
<br>
b) temporary blocking of a user account and deactivation of the associated content</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) for 1 month<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) for 3 months<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) for 6 months<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) for 1 year<br>
<br>
c) permanent blocking of user accounts and all associated content<br>
<br>
d) permanent blocking of the user account and all associated content and inclusion of the access data, in particular the specified e-mail address and other master data for the identification of the user, on a blacklist with the consequence that a new user account cannot be created<br>
<br>
In case required by law, affected users or reporters will be informed of the Provider's decision and given the opportunity to comment. After further comment, the Provider will re-examine the decision and make a final decision on how to deal with the affected content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Complaints and (out-of-court) dispute resolution<br>
 <br>
 </u>The user has the option of filing an appeal against decisions of the Provider, such as the deletion of content or the blocking of accounts or similar, by way of a complaint procedure within six (6) months of receipt of the original decision. The complaint form can be found <a href="passengercars/content-pool/marketing-pool/contact-forms/forms/dsa-contact-form.html" class="wb-link wb-link--inline" target="_blank" data-nn-externallink>here</a>. The Provider will examine this complaint within a period of one month and either annul or confirm the original decision (in whole or in part). The user will be informed of the decision and the reasons by e-mail.<br>
<br>
Complaints that cannot be resolved by the processes described above may be submitted to and processed by a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body. If necessary, information regarding access to an out-of-court dispute settlement body will be made available at an appropriate place on the websites of the Provider. Regardless of the involvement of such a body, the judicial procedure is available anytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Changes to these General Terms and Conditions<br>
 <br>
 </u>The Provider is entitled to amend these <u>General Terms and Conditionse</u> for valid reasons, in particular if new technical developments, further development of the services covered by the contract, changes in legislation and case law or other equivalent reasons make this necessary. If the amendment significantly disturbs the contractual balance between the parties, the amendment shall not be made. The Provider shall notify the users of the amended <u>General Terms and Conditions</u>&nbsp;in text form (including e-mail) at least one month before the effective date of the amendment or supplement (calculated from the date of receipt of the notification by the user). The amended <u>General Terms and Conditions</u>&nbsp;shall be deemed to have been approved if the user does not object within this period of one month from receipt of the notification. The Provider will inform the user separately of this legal consequence in the notification.</p>
